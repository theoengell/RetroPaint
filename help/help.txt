\title{Welcome to Retro Paint}




RetroPaint. It is a tribute to the old graphics hardware that we grew up with and still cherish. It is a way of reliving the nostalgia and the joy that we felt with those machines. RetroPaint is aiming to recreate that experience - in as many ways as possible. You might want to make a giant poster for your bedroom wall, stickers for your band, or something else equally creative and fun. It is not just about making something that works on the hardware, but also about capturing the aesthetic and the mood, in any shape or form you desire. That is why you have the option to use the unrestricted modes and to experiment with different styles and effects (even if that means you can’t transfer it to the original device). It is not always faithful to the original, but that is part of the adventure. And it can still generate those compatible (or close to) old school binaries. I hope that the RetroPaint tools and options make it easy for you to create a result you like or something that you want to refine, maye using other tools too. So, please be creative and join in on the fun, cross the beams! It has to be fun, right?

\section{How do i set precise values?}
You can stretch the window where the slider is making the sliders wider, hence more precise. 
Control Clicking on sliders lets you type values so you can set up precise values. 




\section{How do i edit masks?}
Right Click on layer name lets you enable/disable mask editing. 




\begin{center}
\image{help/pics/help_layers_enable.png}

\section{How do I add my own palette?}
Currently adding palettes only work in c64 mode. You need to have the palette in VICE format (.vpl file) and copy it to the palettes folder in your RetroPaint installation. You need to restart RetroPaint to be able to use newly added palettes.




\section{I installed a new version and all my palettes went missing.}
If you installed a new version of the program in the new inventory then you need to copy palettes to the new folder.




\section{What are the best settings to make conversions?}
It highly depends on the image. There is no one setting that fits all. You need to experiment with different palettes, dithering types and settings. Also tweaking image Adjustments (Adjustments window) might help improve results.




\section{My image seems to have a lot of gray in it, i turn saturation up but there are still lots of grays. How do i make it more colorful?S}
In cases like that you can turn off gray colors in the Colors window, Palette section.




\page{GettingStarted}
\title{Getting Started}
Retro Paint might be a little daunting at times.  Worry not, we will explain everything. We start at the simple task of converting the image to c64 format as an example.
