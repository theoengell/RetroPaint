#Gamma=Changes the gamma of the image. Makes image more or less exposed.
#ApplyCheckerPattern=1 (was it moved to dithering type?)
#BayerLevel=Skews bayer pattern to lean towards lighter/darker values.
#BayerWeight=How much bayer pattern is applied.
#Brightness=Manipulates Brightnes.
#ClaheClipValue=5 ??? cant find it anywhere ???
#ClaheWindowSize=6 ??? cant find it anywhere ???
#Contrast=Manipulates Contrast.
#ContrastCentre=Moves midpoint used for contrast calculations.
#FloydLuminanceMapping=Use luminance table instead of matching colors. (does not work in all modes)
#FloydWeight=How much error is being diffused.
#GaussianLevel=Blurs original image. Usefull for making out of focus backgrounds.
#HighLightGamma=12 Tooltip Not implemented yet (?) Manipulates exposition of highlights.
#HighLightPower=13 Tooltip Not implemented yet (?) ??? not sure atm.
#HighlightRange=14 Tooltip Not implemented yet (?) Defines what is considered highlight.
#Hue=Manipulates Hue - changes colors of the image based on a colorwheel.
#Kelvin=Not implemented yet (?) Changes image "temperature". Lower values make it cold, higher values make it warm.
#LeftRight=17 ??? Changes direction of Skewed Dithering. ????
#LineBlendFactor=Strenght of lines applied.
#LineBlendFactor2=Strenght of second group of lines applied.
#LineBlendLightLines=Number of light lines used in the pattern.
#LineBlendOffset=Offset of the lines.
#LineBlendPair=Should blended lines overlap.
#LineBlendSwap=Does not work (?)
#LineErrorDiffusionFactor=How much error to be diffused along lines.
#LinesBlendDarkLines=Number of dark lines used in the pattern.
#Saturation=Manipulates Saturation.
#ShadowGamma=25 Tooltip Not implemented yet (?) Manipulates exposition of shadows.
#ShadowPower=26 Tooltip Not implemented yet (?) ??? not sure atm.
#ShadowRange=27 Tooltip Not implemented yet (?) Defines what is considered shadow.
#SkewedDithering=Applies dithering diagonally.
#UnsharpMask=Unsharp mask treshold.
#UnsharpMaskBlur=Unsharp mask blur size (?)

------ extras ----
#Grid=Overlay grid pattern to see attributes boundaries
#Original=Show original image
